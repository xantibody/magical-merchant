# Magical Merchant

A minimal note-taking desktop app with Rust core logic and a lightweight UI.

## Design Priorities (in order)

1. **Simple UI** — Minimal chrome, full-screen memo area, hidden actions
2. **Lightweight** — Small bundle, fast startup, no unnecessary dependencies
3. **Stylish** — Clean aesthetics with design tokens (Open Props) and Phosphor Icons

When making UI decisions, always evaluate against these priorities in order.
If a feature adds visual complexity, it must justify itself against simplicity.
If a dependency adds weight, it must justify itself against lightness.

## Milkdown Plugins

| Category | Plugin                    | Import                                 | Purpose                       |
| -------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Built-in | `commonmark`              | `@milkdown/kit/preset/commonmark`      | Base Markdown                 |
| Built-in | `listener`                | `@milkdown/kit/plugin/listener`        | onChange callback             |
| Built-in | `cursor`                  | `@milkdown/kit/plugin/cursor`          | Gap cursor + drop cursor      |
| Built-in | `history`                 | `@milkdown/kit/plugin/history`         | Undo/Redo                     |

| Built-in | `trailing`                | `@milkdown/kit/plugin/trailing`        | Trailing paragraph            |
| Built-in | `linkTooltipPlugin`       | `@milkdown/kit/component/link-tooltip` | Link preview/edit             |
| External | `highlight`               | `@milkdown/plugin-highlight`           | Shiki syntax highlighting     |
| Custom   | `exitCodeBlockPlugin`     | `src/lib/exit-code-block-plugin.ts`    | Mod-Enter to exit code blocks |
| Custom   | `createPlaceholderPlugin` | `src/lib/placeholder-plugin.ts`        | Empty document placeholder    |

Rejected plugins (with reasons):

- `block` / `tooltip` / `slash` — add visible chrome, conflicts with "simple UI"
- `code-block` component — requires CodeMirror (~150KB), conflicts with "lightweight"
- `indent` / `upload` / `image-*` / `table-block` / `list-item-block` — no current feature need

## Editor Performance Principles

Three non-negotiable constraints for Markdown editor design:

1. **Keep the DOM small** — Virtualize or skip nodes outside the visible viewport. DOM node count must not grow linearly with document size
2. **Localize conversion** — Never re-convert the entire Markdown to HTML and replace via innerHTML. Convert only the changed line/block and leverage Solid's fine-grained reactivity
3. **Preserve scroll and selection** — Cursor position, text selection, and scroll offset must survive DOM updates. Full innerHTML replacement destroys these and is prohibited

Reject any implementation that violates these principles, regardless of feature completeness.

## UI Architecture

- **Header**: Toggle button (menu open/close) + current mode icon only
- **Toggle menu**: 3 modes — Timeline / Notes / Tasks
- **Memo area**: Occupies the full screen
- **Actions**: Hidden by default, shown on hover (PC) / flick (mobile)
- **Editing**: Inline Markdown live conversion (Typora-style)

## Linked Notes (wikilinks)

Notes link to each other Obsidian-style, but with zero capture friction:

- **Title**: derived from a note's first heading (or first non-empty line) — there is no title field to fill in
- **`[[Title]]`**: resolves by exact title match in `core`; duplicates resolve to the oldest note so links stay stable
- **Backlinks**: "Linked from" list at the bottom of note preview
- **Unlinked mentions**: "Mentioned in" list — notes whose text contains this note's title without a wikilink; never overlaps with backlinks
- **Timeline integration**: `[[links]]` in timeline and task bodies are clickable and jump to the note (`/notes?note=<filename>`), so every surface feeds the knowledge base
- **Search**: case-insensitive full-text scan in `core` (notes and timeline; the device-context JSON is excluded) — no index, no extra dependencies
- **Command palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)**: one overlay for fuzzy title jump, full-text hits, and timeline matches; zero permanent chrome. Timeline results route via `/?date=<YYYY-MM-DD>`

Design constraints (do not violate):

- Wikilinks render as links only in **preview**; inside the Milkdown editor they stay plain text. A wikilink editor plugin was rejected — it adds bundle weight and editing chrome
- Link/search logic lives in `core` (`note/title.rs`, `note/wikilink.rs`, `note/search.rs`); the frontend only mirrors the resolution policy for unresolved-link styling
